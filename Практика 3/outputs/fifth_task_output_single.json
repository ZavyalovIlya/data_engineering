In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of research dedicated to applications of machine learning in agricultural production systems. The works analyzed were categorized in (a) crop management, including applications on yield prediction, disease detection, weed detection crop quality, and species recognition; (b) livestock management, including applications on animal welfare and livestock production; (c) water management; and (d) soil management. The filtering and classification of the presented articles demonstrate how agriculture will benefit from machine learning technologies.

However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different “thinned” networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.", "Цитирований": 54103, "Колво авторов": 5}, {"title": "Reducing the dimensionality of data with neural networks", "Авторы": "Geoffrey E Hinton, Ruslan R Salakhutdinov", "Дата публикации": "2006/7/28", "Журнал": "science", "Том": "313", "Номер": "5786", "Страницы": "504-507", "Издатель": "American Association for the Advancement of Science", "Описание": "High-dimensional data can be converted to low-dimensional codes by training a multilayer neural network with a small central layer to reconstruct high-dimensional input vectors.

In another dimension, the method compares a priori knowledge of a structural model for the errors with the properties exhibited by the data. Thus this method may help to ensure that orderings of the errors for impulse response and forecast error variance decomposition analyses are sensible, given the data.

The intermediate expansion layer uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features as a source of non-linearity.

The rationale for moving from purely preprogrammed robots to very flexible user-based interfaces for training the robot to perform a task is three-fold. First and foremost, PbD, also referred to as {\\em imitation learning} is a powerful mechanism for reducing the complexity of search spaces for learning. When observing either good or bad examples, one can reduce the search for a possible solution, by either starting the search from the observed good solution (local optima), or conversely, by eliminating from the search space what is known as a bad solution. Imitation learning is, thus, a powerful tool for enhancing and accelerating learning in both animals and artifacts. Second, imitation learning offers an implicit means of training a machine, such that explicit and tedious programming of a task by a human user can be minimized or eliminated (Figure\\ref {fig: what-how}). Imitation learning is thus a``natural''means of interacting with a machine that would be accessible to lay people. And third, studying and modeling the coupling of perception and action, which is at the core of imitation learning, helps us to understand the mechanisms by which the self-organization of perception and action could arise during development. The reciprocal interaction of perception and action could explain how competence in motor control can be grounded in rich structure of perceptual variables, and vice versa, how the processes of perception can develop as means to create successful actions. PbD promises were thus multiple. On the one hand, one hoped that it would make the learning …", "Цитирований": 1717, "Колво авторов": 4}, {"title": "Occam's razor", "Авторы": "Carl Rasmussen, Zoubin Ghahramani", "Дата публикации": "2000", "Журнал": "Advances in neural information processing systems", "Том": "13", "Описание": "The Bayesian paradigm apparently only sometimes gives rise to Occam's Razor; at other times very large models perform well.

We demonstrate that by exploiting a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, we can derive accurate prediction models which typically utilise dramatically fewer basis functions than a comparable ËVM while offering a number of additional advantages. These include the benefits of probabilistic predictions, automatic estimation of'nuisance'parameters, and the facility to utilise arbitrary basis functions (eg non-'Mercer'kernels).
